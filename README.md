# Accessible Campus Assistant - Frontend Starter


## How to use
1. Create a Flutter project: `flutter create accessible_campus_assistant`
2. Replace the generated `lib/` and `pubspec.yaml` with files from this scaffold.
3. Add two images under `assets/images/`:
- `splash.png` (app logo)
- `campus_map.png` (static map mock)
4. Run `flutter pub get` then `flutter run`.


## Next steps (easy integrations)
- Wire authentication to Firebase Auth.
- Replace static campus map with Google Maps and real coordinates.
- Persist reminders with Hive or Sqflite.
- Add Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text packages for navigation.
